# Stretch Goals

As a user, I would like to have a dark mode toggler.

As a user, I would like to have the ability to create an account and have my data saved to my account.

As a user, I would like to have the stores be hyperlinks so that I can be rerouted to another page to complete the purchase of the game, then having it reroute back to the app and adding that game from my wishlist to my owned games.

As a user, on the all games list, I would like to see icons on each game representing which list they are on. A heart icon for on wishlist and a checkmark icon for owned.

As a user, I would like to be able to click on a drop down menu that will reroute to different sorted pages. Sorted by A-Z, Release Date, Genres, Stores, In-Progress games.

As a user, on the view page, I would like to see the list of tags be collapsible so that I can only see three at a time, until I click on a link that expands the entirety of the list.

As a user, on the view page, I would like to see some type of color change that indicates that the status has changed from Not Started to In Progress to Complete.
